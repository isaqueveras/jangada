# ðŸ›¶ Jangada

**Lightning-fast web framework for Go, inspired by Ruby on Rails**

Jangada brings the developer happiness and convention-over-configuration philosophy of Ruby on Rails to the speed and reliability of Go. Build web applications faster than ever while maintaining the performance that only Go can deliver.

## Why Jangada?

- **Rails-inspired**: Familiar MVC architecture with Go's type safety
- **Blazing Fast**: Native Go performance with sub-millisecond response times  
- **Batteries Included**: ORM, routing, templates, CLI tools - everything you need
- **Convention over Configuration**: Sensible defaults, minimal boilerplate
- **Developer Experience**: Hot reloading, powerful generators, intuitive API
- **Production Ready**: Built-in security, monitoring, and scalability features

## Philosophy

Jangada believes that web development should be both **fast to write** and **fast to run**. We combine Rails' developer ergonomics with Go's legendary performance, giving you:

- Rapid prototyping capabilities
- Enterprise-grade scalability  
- Type-safe development
- Predictable, maintainable code
