## Install Jangada CLI

```bash
# Install Jangada
go install github.com/isaqueveras/jangada@latest
```

## Create a new app
Create the foundation of an application to build a monolithic or microservice.

```bash
$ jangada new mercadolivre

# or configure the base with the flags
$ jangada new mercadolivre --mod=github.com/isaqueveras/mercadolivre --host=localhost:8782 --db=postgres
```

## Create a domain layer
The domain layer is where business rules, entities, repositories, and services should be defined.

```bash
$ jangada sail domain crm/customer
```

## Create a application layer
The application layer is where the orchestrators and services that create flows within the system are concentrated.

```bash
$ jangada sail application crm/customer

# or create a new service in the application
$ jangada sail application crm/customer --service=GetAllCustomerByName
```

## Create a transport layer
The transport layer is where you control the rest/grpc/web routes that access the application layer.

```bash
$ jangada sail transport crm/customer

# or create a new method in the controller
$ jangada sail transport crm/customer --layer=rest --name=GetAllCustomerByName
```
